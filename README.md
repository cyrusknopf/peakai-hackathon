# Submission for PeakAI Hack 2024
As part of this hackathon, our team was tasked with analysing a large sales dataset. We visualised the data using Python, and made our analysis, which we presented to the judges.

The final challenge was to make predictions based on the data. We chose to use an ARIMA model to do this sales forecasting.

This repository contains all of our code for the duration of the event, which took place over the course of about 6 hours.
